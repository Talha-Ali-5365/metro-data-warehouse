# METRO Shopping Store Data Warehouse Project Report

## Project Overview

The METRO Shopping Store Data Warehouse project implements a near-real-time data warehousing solution using the MESHJOIN (Mesh Join) algorithm. This system processes streaming transaction data and enriches it with master data to provide a comprehensive view of the store's operations. The project demonstrates the practical application of stream processing techniques in a retail environment, focusing on efficient data integration and real-time analytics capabilities.

### Key Features
1. Near-real-time data processing
2. Stream-based transaction handling
3. Efficient master data integration
4. Concurrent processing using multi-threading
5. Scalable architecture for large data volumes

## Data Warehouse Schema

### Star Schema Design
The data warehouse implements a star schema with the following structure:

#### Fact Table: WAREHOUSE_SALES
- **Transaction Measures**
  - SALE (Fact)
  - QUANTITY (Fact)
  - UNIT_PRICE (Fact)

- **Dimensional References**
  - ORDER_ID (Primary Key)
  - CUSTOMER_ID (Foreign Key)
  - PRODUCT_ID (Foreign Key)
  - SUPPLIER_ID
  - TRANSACTION_ID

#### Dimension Tables
1. **Customer Dimension**
   - CUSTOMER_ID (Primary Key)
   - CUSTOMER_FIRST_NAME
   - CUSTOMER_LAST_NAME
   - CUSTOMER_EMAIL

2. **Product Dimension**
   - PRODUCT_ID (Primary Key)
   - PRODUCT_NAME
   - UNIT_PRICE
   - SUPPLIER_ID
   - SUPPLIER_NAME

3. **Time Dimension** (Derived from ORDER_DATE)
   - Date hierarchies for temporal analysis

### Schema Benefits
1. **Optimized for Analytics**: The star schema design facilitates fast query performance for complex analytical queries
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Dimensional modeling eliminates data redundancy while maintaining data integrity
3. **Flexible Analysis**: Supports various types of analysis across different dimensions
4. **Easy to Understand**: Simple and intuitive structure for business users

## MESHJOIN Algorithm Implementation

### Algorithm Overview
MESHJOIN is specifically designed for joining streaming data with master data in near-real-time data warehousing scenarios. Our implementation focuses on optimizing the join operation between continuous transaction streams and master data (customers and products).

### Key Components

1. **Stream Buffer (Queue)**
   - Implements `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` for thread-safe operations
   - Buffers incoming transactions in chunks of 100 records
   - Ensures smooth handling of varying stream velocities

2. **Master Data Buffer**
   - Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe access
   - Maintains frequently accessed master data in memory
   - Implements LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy for buffer management

3. **Processing Components**
   ```java
   private final int CHUNK_SIZE = 100;
   private final int DISK_BUFFER_SIZE = 20;
   private final Queue<List<Transaction>> streamQueue;
   private final Map<Integer, Customer> customerBuffer;
   private final Map<Integer, Product> productBuffer;
   ```

### Process Flow

1. **Stream Reading**
   - Continuous reading of transaction data
   - Chunking into manageable batches
   - Queue management for backpressure

2. **Master Data Loading**
   - Periodic loading of master data
   - Buffer management and updates
   - Optimization of disk I/O

3. **Join Processing**
   - Parallel processing of stream chunks
   - In-memory joining with master data
   - Result generation and aggregation

4. **Warehouse Writing**
   - Batch writing of processed records
   - Transaction management
   - Error handling and recovery

## MESHJOIN Algorithm Shortcomings

1. **Memory Management Challenges**
   - The algorithm requires significant memory to maintain both stream and master data buffers
   - Risk of memory overflow with large master data sets
   - Need for careful tuning of buffer sizes
   
   **Impact**: Potential performance degradation or system crashes if memory limits are reached

2. **Join Latency Issues**
   - Join operation latency increases with master data size
   - Possible bottlenecks during high-velocity streams
   - Queue buildup during peak loads
   
   **Solution Implemented**: Multi-threading and chunk-based processing to minimize latency

3. **Maintenance Overhead**
   - Complex buffer management logic
   - Difficult to handle master data updates
   - Challenging to maintain consistency during failures
   
   **Mitigation**: Implemented robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
